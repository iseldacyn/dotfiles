# dotfiles

Here are some of my dotfiles for my current linux distro. I run Arch (btw) with xmonad as a window manager.
Also included are some shell scripts/programs I created (or copied from the internet) that are neat

### colors.sh

A neat little shell script I found from StackOverflow that prints all current term colors

### volume.sh

Another shell script inspired from others used to send notifications for changing volume, muting volume, and muting the microphone

### snow.sh

Prints snow to the terminal! I found it somewhere (not sure where, maybe github?) around Winter 2023 and that it was pretty cool!

### batter_noti_daemon.c

Battery notification daemon I created that gets battery from linux file and prints a message to the screen when it gets low.

### neovim

Taken inspiration from ThePrimagen (from YouTube) neovim setup and added some features and things to my liking.

### xmonad/xmobar

I mainly took default configuration files and tweaked them around for what I wanted for my WM / status bar

### tmux

Took inspiration from bindings from Dreams of Code (from YouTube).
