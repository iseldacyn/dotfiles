# Dotfiles Galore!

My current configuration of dotfiles for both PC and laptop configuration.
They are mostly shared, with some minor differences written within the README of corresponding directories.

In this directory:

### .bash_aliases

Aliases I use for certain programs. Notable "nv" for neovim, "ls" with colors, and "ssh" for kitty

### .bashrc

Configuration file for bash startup. Notably changes PS1 layout and color.
GHCup no longer needed since I don't run Xmonad, and .git-prompt.sh does not work properly :(

### .xsession

Defines startup programs for Xorg session. I used to use Xmonad, but switched to Hyprland in June 2024.
Only difference of note requires setting my primary display on my PC to PD input.
