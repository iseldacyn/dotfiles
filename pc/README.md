### xmonad/xmobar

Currently has:
- tree-based tiling
- xmobar on BOTH screens
- bemenu support
- updated active workspaces
- gaps on screen + background
TODO: Update WS to assign it to a screen, move screen focus with mouse but NOT window focus

### scripts

Bemenu configuration and other scripts to make things run on Wayland.

### Hyprland

Doesn't work currently. I used a pre-configured waybar setup, and tried to implement my own binary clock hyprlock (to some avail).
Main issues are compatibility with my Nvidia drivers. I'm not sure if I'll go back to fix that or not if I ever get a new GPU.
I'm currently liking my XMonad setup and am unsure if I will want to switch back.

### xinit

Some programs I run on startup to ensure everything runs smoothly
