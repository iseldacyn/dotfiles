### xmonad/xmobar

Currently has:
- tree-based tiling
- xmobar on BOTH screens
- bemenu support
- updated active workspaces
- gaps on screen + background

UPDATE: Nvidia drivers have been updated for wayland, so I now run Hyprland as my main WM.

### scripts

Bemenu configuration and other scripts to make things run on Wayland.

### Hyprland/waybar

Nvidia drivers have been updated! I have finally configured my waybar to my liking.
Current bugs in my system:
- Hypridle breaks my system???
- Hyprlock needs to be configured further
- With ^, my binary clock scripts needs to be updated to run better as well

### xinit

Some programs I run on startup to ensure everything runs smoothly
