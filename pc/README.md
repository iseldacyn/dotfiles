TODO: Combine to work with laptop folder config

In this directory: 

### xmonad/xmobar

Currently has:
- tree-based tiling
- xmobar on BOTH screens
- bemenu support
- updated active workspaces
- gaps on screen + background

UPDATE: Nvidia drivers have been updated for wayland, so I now run Hyprland as my main WM.

Update 2: I no longer have xmonad installed because of its size, and difficulties emulating hyprland style multi-monitor setup.

### Hypr

Hyprland but for X11. I think it's pretty cool and configured the Hyprbar to look nice (though it only has single monitor support :( ).

### Hyprland/waybar

Nvidia drivers have been updated! I have finally configured my waybar to my liking.
Current bugs in my system:
- Hypridle breaks my system???
- Hyprlock needs to be configured further
- With ^, my binary clock scripts needs to be updated to run better as well

Waybar is kitted out and has some neat features making it more like a windows-style taskbar.
I'm quite proud of it's current functionality. I'm considering updating my laptop to use Hyprland and this style as well.
